Question 1
How is Clojure lazy? Why is that important?

Question 2
What does an empty collection act like in a Boolean context?
Is there a good way to deal with this (if so, how)?

Question 3
What's the difference between nil and false?

Question 4
Define a function that takes two arguments and returns the
    greater of the two.

Question 5
Give iterative and recursive definitions of a function that

    a. takes a positive integer and prints that many dots.

    b. takes a list and returns the number of times the symbol a 
       occurs in it.

Question 6 
Write a function called list­of­nums n that will return a list of numbers (1 2 ... n )

Question 7 
Write a Clojure function (remove­multiples k nlist) that will remove the multiples of k from a list of numbers nlist. So remove­multiples of 3 from list­of­nums 6 should produce 1 2 4 5.

Question 8
Write a function 'sieve n' that produces the prime numbers (and 1) up through n.  [Sound familiar?]

Question 9
Implement Fizzbuzz but instead say "want" for multiples of 2 and "cookie" for multiples of 3 and "MeWantCookie" for multiples of 6.  Comment and Explain exactly which method you chose and why/how it works - in language terms (a reference or two might be a good idea...) for full credit. 

Please submit your code answers as a text file, include Word/libreoffice/etc document with screenshots of output,please.

--Yes, question 9 may be tricky to do well.--
